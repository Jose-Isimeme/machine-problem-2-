## How to run this code
A makefile has been provided to help in the compilation and running of this code. Here are the steps to run the code:

1. make server
2. make client
3. ./server [ip address] [port] [max number of clients]
4. ./client [username] [ip address] [port]

This will start the chat service and you can begin to chat between different clients. 

*Note: For the ip address, it is easiest to use hostname -I to find the local Ip Address of your device and use that for both the client and the server.
